# Meta-Cognition Learning Capture - User Acceptance Testing Guide

## Overview

This guide provides step-by-step instructions to test the Learning Capture functionality in Archon's MCP server. Follow these steps to verify that debugging experiences can be captured, stored, and retrieved successfully.

## System Architecture & Flow

### Components Involved

1. **MCP Server** (Port 8051)
   - FastMCP framework handling HTTP/JSON-RPC requests
   - Learning Capture module (`learning_capture_module.py`)
   
2. **Metacognition Service** (`src/server/services/metacognition/`)
   - `session_analyzer.py` - Analyzes and structures raw input
   - `learning_formatter.py` - Creates structured learning entries with synopsis
   - `knowledge_storage.py` - Handles file and database storage

3. **Service Client**
   - HTTP client for communicating with Archon API server
   - Handles Supabase storage operations

4. **Storage Systems**
   - Local filesystem: `knowledge/metacognition/` for markdown files
   - Supabase database: For RAG-searchable documents

### Expected Processing Flow

When a debugging experience is sent to Archon:

```
1. HTTP Request â†’ MCP Server (port 8051)
   â†“
2. MCP Server â†’ Routes to Learning Capture Module
   â†“
3. Learning Capture Module â†’ Validates input parameters
   â†“
4. Session Analyzer â†’ Creates session data structure
   - Generates session ID (e.g., "external-project-20250113-143052")
   - Adds timestamp and project context
   - Wraps raw input into debugging_experiences array
   â†“
5. Learning Formatter â†’ Processes session data
   - Determines trigger type (error/performance/investigation)
   - Extracts situation details (goal, actions, results)
   - Creates debug journey (hypothesis, steps, dead ends)
   - Generates resolution (root cause, solution, verification)
   - Synthesizes knowledge (domain/universal principles)
   - Creates synopsis (v2 format with bullets)
   â†“
6. Knowledge Storage â†’ Saves to filesystem
   - Generates markdown file with PRD format
   - Creates file in knowledge/metacognition/
   - Returns absolute file path
   â†“
7. Archon Integration â†’ Stores in Supabase
   - Formats entry for Archon storage
   - Calls service_client.store_knowledge()
   - Adds metadata (session_id, project_context, tags)
   - Returns document ID
   â†“
8. Response â†’ Returns JSON with results
   - Success status
   - Session ID
   - File path
   - Storage results
```

### Detailed Logic Steps

#### Step 1: Request Reception
- MCP server receives POST request at `/mcp`
- Validates JSON-RPC 2.0 format
- Extracts method name and parameters

#### Step 2: Tool Routing
- Identifies `capture_learning` method
- Passes to registered tool handler
- Extracts context from request

#### Step 3: Data Structuring
```python
# Creates session data structure:
session_data = {
    "session_id": "external-{project}-{timestamp}",
    "timestamp": "ISO-8601 timestamp",
    "project_context": "provided project name",
    "debugging_experiences": [{
        "problem_description": "user provided",
        "investigation_steps": ["user provided list"],
        "solution_applied": "user provided",
        "outcome": "user provided"
    }]
}
```

#### Step 4: Learning Entry Creation
```python
# Learning formatter creates comprehensive entry:
learning_entry = {
    "id": "L001",
    "timestamp": "ISO timestamp",
    "trigger": "error|performance|investigation",
    "situation": {
        "goal": "inferred from problem",
        "action_taken": "extracted from steps",
        "expected_result": "inferred",
        "actual_result": "from problem description"
    },
    "debug_journey": {
        "initial_hypothesis": "from first step",
        "investigation_path": ["cleaned steps"],
        "dead_ends": ["identified failures"]
    },
    "resolution": {
        "root_cause": "inferred from solution",
        "solution": "provided solution",
        "verification": "from outcome"
    },
    "knowledge_synthesis": {
        "domain_principle": "technology-specific",
        "universal_principle": "transferable",
        "pattern_recognition": "reusable indicators",
        "mental_model": "conceptual understanding"
    },
    "synopsis": {
        "title": "max 120 chars",
        "bullets": {
            "symptoms": "what went wrong",
            "context": "environment",
            "root_cause": "why it happened",
            "fix": "solution applied",
            "applies_when": "usage pattern"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Step 5: Markdown Generation
- Creates structured markdown following PRD format
- Includes all sections: Situation, Debug Journey, Resolution, Knowledge Synthesis
- Adds Quick Reference Synopsis for v2 format
- Saves to `knowledge/metacognition/learning-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md`

#### Step 6: Supabase Storage
- Formats content for RAG optimization
- Adds searchable tags and metadata
- Stores via service client HTTP call to API server
- API server saves to Supabase documents table

#### Step 7: Search Processing
When searching for learning:
```
1. Search request â†’ MCP Server
2. Build enhanced query with source filters
3. Service client â†’ API server â†’ Supabase
4. Vector similarity search + full-text search
5. Results ranked by relevance score
6. Formatted results returned to caller
```

### No Agents Involved

**Note**: This implementation does NOT use AI agents. All processing is deterministic:
- Pattern matching for trigger detection
- Rule-based extraction for situation details
- Template-based formatting for output
- No LLM calls or AI agent orchestration

The "intelligence" comes from:
- Structured data format enforcement
- Pattern recognition in problem descriptions
- Heuristic-based inference for missing fields
- Comprehensive template for knowledge synthesis

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"test-1\", \"method\": \"capture_learning\", \"params\": {\"problem_description\": \"ImportError: No module named requests even though requests is installed\", \"investigation_steps\": [\"Checked if requests is installed with pip list\", \"Verified Python version matches pip version\", \"Discovered virtual environment was not activated\"], \"solution_applied\": \"Activated the virtual environment before running the script\", \"outcome\": \"Script ran successfully with all imports working\", \"project_context\": \"test-python-project\", \"additional_context\": {\"language\": \"python\", \"error_type\": \"import_error\", \"python_version\": \"3.10\"}}}"
```

**For Unix/Mac**:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8051/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": "test-1",
    "method": "capture_learning",
    "params": {
      "problem_description": "ImportError: No module named requests even though requests is installed",
      "investigation_steps": [
        "Checked if requests is installed with pip list",
        "Verified Python version matches pip version",
        "Discovered virtual environment was not activated"
      ],
      "solution_applied": "Activated the virtual environment before running the script",
      "outcome": "Script ran successfully with all imports working",
      "project_context": "test-python-project",

        "status": "stored"
      }
    ],
    "message": "Successfully captured learning from test-python-project"
  }
}
```

#### Step 1.4: Verify Markdown File Created

Navigate to: `D:\D drive\GitHub\Archon\knowledge\metacognition\`

**Expected Result**:
- A new file named `learning-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` exists
- Opening the file shows structured learning entry with:
  - Session header with ID and timestamp
  - Learning Entry with Situation, Debug Journey, Resolution, and Knowledge Synthesis sections
  - All provided information properly formatted

#### Step 1.5: Verify Supabase Storage

Open Archon UI at http://localhost:3737 and navigate to Knowledge page.

**Expected Result**:
- New entry appears in knowledge items list
- Source type shows as "learning_capture"
- Can search for "ImportError requests" and find the entry

---

### Scenario 2: Session Learning Capture

**Objective**: Test capturing learning from a full session transcript.

#### Step 2.1: Send Session Content

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8051/mcp ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"test-2\", \"method\": \"capture_session_learning\", \"params\": {\"session_content\": \"User: I am getting TypeError: Cannot read property length of undefined in my React component.\\nAssistant: This error occurs when you try to access the length property of a variable that is undefined. Let me help you debug this.\\nUser: The error happens in my map function when rendering a list.\\nAssistant: The issue is likely that your data hasn't loaded yet. You should add a check before mapping.\\nUser: Adding a conditional check with data && data.map() fixed it!\\nAssistant: Great! This is a common pattern in React - always check if data exists before accessing its properties.\", \"project_name\": \"react-todo-app\", \"session_type\": \"debugging\", \"tags\": [\"react\", \"javascript\", \"type-error\"]}}"
```

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "test-2",
  "result": {
    "success": true,
    "session_id": "session-react-todo-app-20250113-144523",
    "experiences_found": 1,
    "entries_created": 1,
    "markdown_file": "D:\\D drive\\GitHub\\Archon\\knowledge\\metacognition\\learning-20250113-144523.md",
    "archon_storage": [
      {
        "entry_id": "L001",
        "document_id": "uuid-yyyy",
        "status": "stored"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Scenario 3: Search Learning Database

**Objective**: Verify that stored learning can be searched and retrieved.

#### Step 3.1: Search for Python Import Error

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8051/mcp ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"test-3\", \"method\": \"search_learning\", \"params\": {\"query\": \"ImportError module requests\", \"max_results\": 5}}"
```

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "test-3",
  "result": {
    "success": true,
    "query": "ImportError module requests",
    "project_filter": null,
    "results_count": 1,
    "results": [
      {
        "content": "# Learning: ImportError: No module named requests...",
        "title": "Learning: ImportError: No module named requests even though requests is installed",
        "metadata": {
          "session_id": "external-test-python-project-20250113-143052",
          "project_context": "test-python-project",
          "language": "python"
        },
        "score": 0.89
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

#### Step 3.2: Search for React Type Error

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8051/mcp ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"test-4\", \"method\": \"search_learning\", \"params\": {\"query\": \"TypeError undefined React\", \"project_filter\": \"react-todo-app\"}}"
```

**Expected Result**:
- Returns the React debugging entry from Scenario 2
- Project filter correctly limits results to "react-todo-app"

---

### Scenario 4: Error Handling

**Objective**: Verify proper error handling for invalid inputs.

#### Step 4.1: Missing Required Parameter

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8051/mcp ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"test-5\", \"method\": \"capture_learning\", \"params\": {\"solution_applied\": \"Some solution\"}}"
```

**Expected Result**:
- Returns error response indicating missing "problem_description"
- Does not create any files or database entries

#### Step 4.2: Invalid Method Name

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8051/mcp ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"jsonrpc\": \"2.0\", \"id\": \"test-6\", \"method\": \"invalid_method\", \"params\": {}}"
```

**Expected Result**:
```json
{
  "jsonrpc": "2.0",
  "id": "test-6",
  "error": {
    "code": -32601,
    "message": "Method not found: invalid_method"
  }
}
```
